# ICAMS

An open source module in python for InSAR troposphere Correction using global Atmospheric Models that considers the spatial Stochastic properties of the troposphere (ICAMS). We model the tropospheric parameters (P,T, and e) layer by layer along the altitude levels, and we calculate the InSAR delays along the LOS direction. ICAMS can be applied with all of the weather models (global or local). Currently, our code support to download and process ERA5 reanalysis data from ECMWF.
